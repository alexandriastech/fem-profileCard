## My process

First, I decided to give myself a timeline of when I hope to finish this challenge. My process focuses on exposure and well, a lot of practice. I worked from the background to the card (holding the information). Within the card, I worked top to bottom (the background image, profile image, . . . , to the stats).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow!

### What I learned

I learned how to use background-image for this project.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on best CSS practices in the future and reading more documentation.

## Acknowledgments

I really struggled with the background images, so I had to search for different ways to fix it. I discovered the calc function in CSS through ApplePieGiraffe because I tried other positioning but calculating works best. So big thanks to them! Now, I understand the calc function after playing with it.
